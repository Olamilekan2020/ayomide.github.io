my name is YUSUF FAWAS AYOMIDE, am hail from kwara state but resides in
lagos,badagry to be precise and went to my primary school and secondary school at badagry.
and during my secondary school  days i was loved by all the teachers who taught me and in my ss,
class i was made the sport prefect and was given award at my ss2 as the best sport prefect of all
times.

I Graduated 2016 and did my jamb immediately and had a score of 244 and which unilorin denied me,
so i decided that instead of staying home i went to work at a biscuit company and still continue 
searching for admission and 2018 i gained admission into kwasu and was giving the course LIS...
And i made new friends and have been able to learn new things.</h1></font>
